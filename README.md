# Jamming

## Description
The purpose of this app is to add searched tracks from Spotify's database to a new playlist. The end user
is able to use the search bar to search for tracks by name, artist or album. They can then choose which songs
they want to add to the new playlist and the selected tracks will be shown in a queue in which they can also be removed.
Once all the desired tracks are selected, the user can name the new playlist and save it to their Spotify account.

## Features
- Tracks that were added to the queue cannot be added again (prevents duplicate tracks when creating new playlist)
- Responsive - Works well with desktop, tablet, or mobile

1. Download zip file of repo
